# 1. Exercise 2
- Open the notebook file at `Exercise 02` in the Google Classroom at your coding environment
- You can use the following coding environment: [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Run each cell in the notebook one by one and learn what the codes in each cell do
- Save the notebook after running all the cells as a PDF file and submit it to the Google Classroom [1pt] (no partial points will be given)

# 2. Code Completion
- Open the following notebook at your coding environment: [assignment-02-a.ipynb](https://gitlab.com/byungwoohong/class-2020-2-machinelearningproject/-/blob/master/assignment/02/assignment-02-a.ipynb)
- Complete the missing parts in the code in such a way that the followed results can be obtained [2pt] (no partial points will be given)

# 3. Supervised Linear Regression
- Open the following notebook at your coding environment: [assignment-02-b.ipynb](https://gitlab.com/byungwoohong/class-2020-2-machinelearningproject/-/blob/master/assignment/02/assignment-02-b.ipynb)
- Complete the missing parts in the code in such a way that the followed results can be obtained [11pt] (partial points will be given)

# 4. Github History
- Use the `git` commands `commit` and `push` at your github account for the [assignment-02-b.ipynb] notebook so that have a history at github
- Make at least the following `commit` with given messages 
- Save the history page as a PDF file and submit it to the Google Classroom [2pt] (no partial points will be given)

$ git commit -a -m "plot the training data"
$ git push -u origin master
